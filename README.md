# APINotes
This is my notes for API.

## API = "Application Programing Interface"
- No user interface
- APIs are used to communicate with other applications
  - Amazon need credit cart information from Visa
  - Thus, Amazon send request with its API and Visa get that request with its API
  - Then, Visa will sents respons With its API to Amazon's API. 
  - All works if API understand each other. 
- API should accept multiply format (JSON,XML,..).

### API --> Data Base
- insert / update / delete / read => API's Tasks / operations
- we should give URL to these operations (End Points).
- You can have many URL in your API because you can have variety of options for every tasks.
  - you can insert student, parents, grade, teacher to data base.
  - You can also upodate each of them. Thus, you will need many URL(End Points).
